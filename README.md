# Land Surface Temperature Analysis using Google Earth Engine
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for analyzing Land Surface Temperature (LST) patterns using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The project focuses on understanding the relationship between urban land use/land cover changes and their impacts on surface temperature variations.
Features

#Retrieval of LST from Landsat satellite imagery
Calculation of various spectral indices (NDVI, NDBI, NDWI)
Analysis of temporal LST changes
Correlation analysis between LST and land cover types
Visualization of LST patterns and thermal variations

#Prerequisites

Google Earth Engine account
Basic understanding of remote sensing concepts
Familiarity with JavaScript (for GEE Code Editor)

#Data Sources

Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery
Landsat 5 TM imagery (for historical analysis)
Land use/land cover data
Administrative boundaries

#Methods
The repository implements various approaches for LST analysis:

Radiative transfer equation method for LST retrieval
Land use/land cover classification
Statistical correlation analysis
Temporal trend analysis
